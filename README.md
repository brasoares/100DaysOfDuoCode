# 100DaysOfDuoCode 🚀

Welcome to **100DaysOfDuoCode**, where I combine Python 🐍 and Java ☕ to tackle the 2025 #100DaysOfCode challenge! 🎯  

This repository is my public space for sharing progress, projects, and lessons learned as I advance through **Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** on #Udemy, while recreating the same challenges in Java to broaden my skills.
